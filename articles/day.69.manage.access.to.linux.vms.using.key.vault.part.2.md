## Install sshpass

**[sshpass](https://linux.die.net/man/1/sshpass)** is a command line tool that allows you to provide a password for non-interactive-password authentication inside a bash prompt.

Run the following command to install **sshpass**.

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y sshpass
```

You should get back the following response.

```console

## Retrieve the SSH Private Key from Key Vault

Run the following command to retrieve the SSH Private Key from the Key Vault and store it in **/tmp**.

```bash
SSH_PRIVATE_KEY=$(/usr/bin/az keyvault secret download \
--name "100-days-linux-vm" \
--vault-name "iac100dayslinuxkv" \
--file "/tmp/100-days-linux-vm" \
--output tsv 2>&1)
```

Next, run the following command to change the permissions on the SSH Private Key to **0600**.

```bash
chmod 0600 "/tmp/100-days-linux-vm"
```

</br>

## Retrieve the SSH Private Key Password from Key Vault

Run the following command to retrieve the SSH Private Key from the Key Vault and store it into the environment variable, **SSHPASS**.

```bash
export SSHPASS=$(/usr/bin/az keyvault secret show \
--name "100-days-linux-vm-password" \
--vault-name "iac100dayslinuxkv" \
--query value \
--output tsv 2>&1)
```

</br>

## Login to the Linux VM using your SSH Key and Password

Next, run the following command to login to the Linux VM via SSH

```bash
sshpass \
-P "pass" \
-e \
ssh \
-o "StrictHostKeyChecking=no" \
-o "UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null" \
-i "/tmp/100-days-linux-vm" \
lxvmadmin@iac-100-linux-vm.westeurope.cloudapp.azure.com
```

You should get back the following response where you are then logged into the Linux VM in Azure.

```console
Warning: Permanently added 'iac-100-linux-vm.westeurope.cloudapp.azure.com,40.115.61.255' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.

To run a command as administrator (user "root"), use "sudo <command>".
See "man sudo_root" for details.

lxvmadmin@100dayslinuxvm:~$
```

</br>

When you are finished, logout of the Linux VM and then run the command below to delete the Private Key from your Host.

```bash
rm -f "/tmp/100-days-linux-vm"
```

Next, set the SSHPASS Environment Variable to a value of null.

```bash
export SSHPASS=""
```

</br>

## Things to Consider

When using **sshpass**, you have the option to use **-p** option to directly pass in the password you want to use; however, the password will then appear in cleartext in **ps** output. This is why we used the **-e** option instead to store the SSH Private Key Password in the environment variable **SSHPASS**. Be aware, that this has its own security risks as well if the Linux Host you are working from is ever compromised.

While you are busy automating your processes for using the Private SSH Key to deploy and manage a Linux Host, make sure you are removing the Private Key from your automation Host and setting the **SSHPASS** environment variable to null before you finish your automation process.

## Conclusion

In today's article in we deployed a Linux VM using the SSH Keys and Password from Azure Key Vault. If there's a specific scenario that you wish to be covered in future articles, please create a **[New Issue](https://github.com/starkfell/100DaysOfIaC/issues)** in the [starkfell/100DaysOfIaC](https://github.com/starkfell/100DaysOfIaC/) GitHub repository.
