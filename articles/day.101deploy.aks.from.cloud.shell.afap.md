# Day 101 - Deploying an AKS Cluster FAST from Azure Cloud Shell

Welcome to the first installment of "100 MORE Days of Infrastructure-as-Code in Azure"! In today's article we will be covering how to deploy an AKS Cluster from Azure Cloud Shell, but with a new facet - Youtube video! The code and related artifacts for each new installment will be here with a link to the video on our YouTube channel.

Today, we're covering quick and effective AKS cluster deployment with Azure Cloud Shell. While our demonstration is not recommended for a Production Environment, we hope it will provide a way to quickly deploy and AKS cluster for study and exam prep! Additionally, we have opted to use a walkthrough video instead of an article. In order to make things as easy as possible, all commands in the video are able to be copy and pasted from the **[Video Walkthrough Commands](#video-walkthrough-commands)** section.

Find the code and reference links below!

## Video Walkthrough Commands (aka "the code")

All commands used in video are in the document below.

RAND=$(shuf -i 1-9999 -n 1)

# Creating the Azure Resource Group for the AKS Service.
az group create \
--name "aks-iam-${RAND}" \
--location "westeurope"

# Deploying our AKS Cluster.
az aks create \
--name "aks-iam-${RAND}" \
--dns-name-prefix "aks-iam-${RAND}" \
--node-resource-group "aks-iam-${RAND}-nodes" \
--resource-group "aks-iam-${RAND}" \
--location "westeurope" \

# Retrieving the [admin] credentials as a [kubeconfig] file to use to login to the AKS Cluster.
az aks get-credentials \
--name "aks-iam-${RAND}" \
--resource-group "aks-iam-${RAND}" \
--file "aks-iam-${RAND}-admin-kubeconfig" \
--admin

# Setting the [kubectl] command to point at our [kubeconfig] file.
export KUBECONFIG=./aks-iam-${RAND}-admin-kubeconfig

# Retrieving information about the AKS Cluster.
kubectl cluster-info

# Listing the Worker Nodes on the AKS Cluster.
kubectl get nodes

# Removing the AKS Cluster.
az aks cluster delete \
--name "aks-iam-${RAND}" \
--resource-group "aks-iam-${RAND}"

# Removing the [kubeconfig] file from our Azure Cloud Shell session.
rm -rf ./aks-iam-${RAND}-admin-kubeconfig
