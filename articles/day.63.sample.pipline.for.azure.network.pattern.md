# Day 63 - Sample Pipeline For Azure Network Pattern

*Today's post comes from guest contributor Tao Yang [@MrTaoYang](https://twitter.com/mrtaoyang). Tao is a Microsoft MVP who from 9-to-5 focuses on DevOps and governance in Azure for enterprise customers.

It is time to get practical. Today I am going to show you a pattern I have developed for my lab environment.

>**DOWNLOAD:** The entire pattern (templates, parameter files, tests, scripts, etc.) can be found at my GitHub repository [HERE](https://github.com/tyconsulting/azure.network). Feel free to download / fork it.

When setting up a new Azure environment, networking is probably the first pattern you need to design and implement. The pattern and pipeline I'm showing you today deploys the following resources to multiple subscriptions within a same Azure AD tenant:

* A hub VNet in the management sub
* Multiple spoke VNets across multiple workload subs
* VNet peering between the hub and all spoke VNets
* (Optional) Site-to-Site VPN to on-prem network, which consists of VPN gateway, local network gateway and VPN connection.
* (Optional) A subnet dedicated for Azure AD DS in the Hub VNet. - AADDS itself is not part of this pattern.
* Various Bastion Hosts for several VNets
* An NSG for each VNet
* A Private DNS Zone that is linked to all the Hub and Spoke VNets

>**IMPORTANT NOTE:** This pattern does not include any advanced network resource such as firewall, User-Defined Route (UDR), or Application Security Groups (ASR). Although this is sufficient for my **lab** environment, it may not be production ready.

## Pipeline Configuration

A YAML pipeline ([***azure-pipelines.yml***](https://github.com/tyconsulting/azure.network/blob/master/azure-pipelines.yml)) is included in the repo. The Pipeline requires the following objects need to be created in Azure DevOps project:

### Marketplace Extensions

This pipeline uses tasks from the following extensions that can be installed via Azure DevOps Marketplace:
| Name | Link |
|:-----|:-----|
| Pester Test Runner Build Task | <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=richardfennellBM.BM-VSTS-PesterRunner-Task> |

### Service Connections

| Name | Type | Target |
|:----:|:----:|:------:|
| sub-mgmt | Azure Resource Manager | Management Sub |
| sub-workload-1 | Azure Resource Manager | Workload Sub #1|
| sub-workload-2 | Azure Resource Manager | Workload Sub #2|

### Variable Groups

### Pipeline steps

The pipeline contains 2 stages:

* test_and_build
* lab_deploy

>**NOTE:** The lab_deploy stage includes steps to deploy all required resources across multiple subscriptions (management sub and workload subs), because my lab environment consists multiple subscriptions within a single Azure AD tenant.

![004](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tyconsulting/azure.network/master/images/pipeline_stages.png)

### **test_and_build** stage

This stage consists of the following steps:

* Pester-test all three (3) ARM templates in the solution
    * Hub VNet template
    * Spoke VNet template
    * VNet peering template
* ARM deployment validation
* Publish build artifacts

### **lab_deploy** stage

This stage consists of the following ARM deployment tasks

* Deploy Hub VNet in the Management subscription
* Deploy all spoke VNet in multiple Workload subscriptions
* Create VNet peerings between the Hub VNet and each Spoke VNet
* Create an Azure Private DNS zone and linked it to all the hub and spoke VNet that were deployed in this pattern.

>**IMPORTANT NOTE:** The deployment for VPN gateways and Bastion hosts can take very long time to finish. In my lab, this pipeline takes more than one (1) hour to execute. When using free Microsoft hosted agents, the maximum pipeline execution time is 60 minutes. Depending on your pipeline, if you are using Microsoft hosted agents, you may need to purchase an additional parallel job in order to increase the maximum execution time to 6 hours.

## Conclusion

In this article, I have demonstrated how was the fundamental networking pattern deployed in my lab environment using ARM templates and Azure DevOps YAML pipeline. Although in my opinion the pattern is only designed for a lab / dev environment, I hope you have learned something from this example.
