# Day 29 - Build Pipelines, using Variables (Windows Edition)

In today's article we are going to cover how to use a Storage Account Key in an Azure PowerShell Task in a Build Pipeline. The methods demonstrated in this article can also be used for several other IaaS and PaaS Offerings available in Azure.

> **NOTE:** This article was tested and written for an Azure Build Pipeline using a Microsoft-hosted Agent running vs2017-win2016 and a separate Windows Host running Windows 10 with Azure CLI installed.

## Create a Resource Group and Storage Account

<br />

On your Windows Host (with Azure CLI installed), open up a PowerShell prompt and run the following command to create a new Resource Group.

```powershell
az group create `
--name encrypted-variables `
--location westeurope
```

You should get back the following output:

```console
{
  "id": "/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/encrypted-variables",
  "location": "westeurope",
  "managedBy": null,
  "name": "encrypted-variables",
  "properties": {
    "provisioningState": "Succeeded"
  },
  "tags": null,
  "type": "Microsoft.Resources/resourceGroups"
}
```

<br />

Next, run the following command randomly generate 4 alphanumeric characters.

```powershell
$RandomAlpha = (New-Guid).ToString().Substring("0","4")
```

> **NOTE:** We are appending this to the name of our Storage Account to ensure we create a unique Storage Account name.

<br />

Run the following command to create a new Storage Account.

```powershell
$NewStorageAccount = az storage account create `
--name "encryptvardemo$RandomAlpha" `
--resource-group encrypted-variables
```

You should get back the following output:

```console
The default kind for created storage account will change to 'StorageV2' from 'Storage' in future
 - Running ..
```

<br />

Run the following command to verify that the Storage Account was provisioned successfully.

```powershell
($NewStorageAccount | ConvertFrom-Json).provisioningState
```

You should get back the following output:

```console
"Succeeded"
```

<br />

Next, run the following command to retrieve the Primary Key for your new Storage Account.

```powershell
az storage account keys list `
--account-name "encryptvardemo$RandomAlpha" `
--query [0].value `
--output tsv
```

You should get back the Primary Key of your new Storage Account which should look similar to the one below:

```console
lB7TsIMia9dCqFBI1ICC0u5JHQeZO87fBpy5adfy9x/kb80k9vJ0wSObbGLfxBXnVpmJZDZ3T8S62o7y5gualA==
```

<br />

## Using the Storage Account Key in a Build Pipeline Variable

Next, in an Azure DevOps Pipeline, click on the Variables tab and copy the Storage Account Key into a a new variable called **primaryStorageAccountKey**.

<br />

Next, change the Storage Account Key value by pressing the **Lock Icon** on the far right side of the **primaryStorageAccountKey** variable.

![002](../images/day29/day.29.build.pipes.encrypted.variables.windows.002.png)

<br />

The Storage Account Key should now be secured and displayed only as a set of asterisks.

<br />

Next, on the Tasks section in the Build Pipeline, create an Azure PowerShell Task called **retrieve-encrypted-variables** and paste in the following code below as an Inline script. After your task looks like what is shown below, click on **Save & queue** to run the Build.

```powershell
# Retrieving and using a Storage Account Key from Build Pipeline Variables.

Write-Output "Primary Storage Account Key: $(primaryStorageAccountKey)"
```

> NOTE: If the Azure PowerShell Task is asking you for an *Azure PowerShell Version* to use, just choose the **Latest installed version** option.

![003](../images/day29/day.29.build.pipes.encrypted.variables.windows.003.png)

<br />

When the Build finishes, you should see the Storage Account Key displayed in all asterisks.

![004](../images/day29/day.29.build.pipes.encrypted.variables.windows.004.png)

Although the job displays the Storage Account Key in asterisks, the value can still be used in your script where required.

<br />
