# Day 56 - Troubleshooting Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Template Deployment

If you are deploying ARM templates via Azure Pipelines, the Azure Portal, or PowerShell, it pays to know the basics of the types of errors you may get, where to find the error messages, and how to interpret them. Below are the resources you need to master Azure Resource Manager deployment errors no matter which deployment method you use.

## ARM Deployment Error Types

There are important differences between **template validation error**, and a **template deployment error**. A template validation error means there is a problem with the syntax or layout of your deployment template, which prevents the deployment from starting. A template deployment error means that your template syntax has been approved, but an error has occurred while provisioning the resources.

 Both types of errors return an error code you can use to troubleshoot the deployment. Both error types appear in the Azure Activity Log. However, validation errors don't appear in your deployment history because the deployment never started. If you use the template deployment in the Azure portal and your template is invalid, you'll see an error like that shown in Figure 1 when you click the purchase button:

## Finding error details in the Azure Portal

 If you have a conflict not caught in the pre-flight check, you can find the error in the properties of the failed deployment or the **Azure Activity Log**. To get to the Activity Logs 

1. Sign in to the Azure portal.
2. Select Monitor > Activity log.
3. Use the filters to find the log.

## Enable debug logging in PowerShell**

Sometimes you need more information about the request and response to learn what went wrong. During deployment, you can request that additional information is logged during a deployment.

In PowerShell, you can set the DeploymentDebugLogLevel parameter to All, ResponseContent, or RequestContent. For troubleshooting, set `-DeploymentDebugLogLevel All`

``` PowerShell
New-AzResourceGroupDeployment `
 -Name MyArmDeployment `
 -ResourceGroupName MyArmResGroup `
 -TemplateFile c:\scripts\ArmTemplates\storage.json `
 -DeploymentDebugLogLevel All
  ```

## Debugging in VS Code

If you load the Preview version of [Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Tools](#https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msazurermtools.azurerm-vscode-tools) for VS Code, you can troubleshoot ARM template deployment directly in VS Code. According to the extension documentation, the new language server now has a better understanding of Azure Resource Manager templates and can therefore provide a better error and completion experience beyond that provided using standard JSON validation, and:
- Narrows down its schema validation based on the resource type and apiVersion properties of each resource.
- No longer suggests changing the resource type if the apiVersion is not supported, or if a property is missing or invalid (as tools using standard JSON validation would do)
- Errors provide better guidance for what actually needs to be fixed in each resource to match the schema
